In short, this is:

# An easy extendable renderer used in practicing.

I had almost completed all works of the first stage(Rasterization) when I first wrote this `Readme.md`... So excuse me for some case I may forget.  

However, I would try my best to restore the whole procession of how I implemented it and clarify the function of my entire code step by step.  

This `Readme.md` is just a catalog of my introduction docs, and the rest docs is as follows:  

- The essence of my renderer
- The code design and implementation of functions
- The logs in developing

The project is still developing.
